Steps to Push the Cloned Repository to a New GitHub Repository


Clone the original repository using Git Bash. Replace https://github.com/original-repo-owner/original-repo.git with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/original-repo-owner/original-repo.git


Navigate to Your Cloned Repository Directory:
Open Git Bash and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
sh
Copy code
cd path/to/cloned-repo

  
Add Your New GitHub Repository as a Remote:
Add your new GitHub repository as a remote. Replace https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git with the URL of your new GitHub repository.
sh
Copy code
git remote add new-repo https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git


Push to the New Repository:
Push the entire repository to the new remote repository. This will push all branches and tags.
sh
Copy code
git push new-repo --all

  
Set the New Repository as the Default Origin (Optional):
If you want to make your new repository the default origin for future pushes, you can remove the old origin and rename new-repo to origin.
sh
Copy code
git remote remove origin
git remote rename new-repo origin
